I chose to keep all the operations in the same loop do to how identical each was performed, making it easier to edit issues that they might have.

The BST operations seem to function correctly and show no errors. 

The AVL operations seem to run slower than the normal BST, as was to be expected, but otherwise functions somewhat in tests. The AVL does appear to have a few errors, as it fails when trying the equillibrium function.
